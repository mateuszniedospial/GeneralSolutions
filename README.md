# GeneralSolutions 

Algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc. Implemented for educational purposes only.

The project serves as a learning platform. It includes my own implementations of basic and well knowns algorithms, data structures
and also provides many examples of language capabilities (reflection, generics, concurrency and so on). 

All implementations are inspired by books or code provided in Java APIs.

Since June 2017 the project has been extended of Scala Package.
It was done for learning basics of the language and therefore some of the new algorithms or exercises
are going to be written in Scala instead of Java. This does not interfere in the general project structure 
as both of the languages works together without any problem.

If anyone would like to use some of the implementations for own reasons please feel free to do so, but note
that I do not provide any assurance that everything is working as expected on a proffessional level.
Almost everything is described more precisely using comments in appropriate files.

To use this project on IntelliJ Idea the following list of plugins is needed:
- scala,
- .ignore.

To configure project simply clone it using HTTPS or SSH and open it in IntelliJ using option
'from exisiting sources'. After this IntelliJ will guide You through entire process and additional settings. 
Note that of course appropriate version of JDK and Scala SDK is needed.
